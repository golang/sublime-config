# golangconfig Package Developer Documentation

`golangconfig` is an API for package developers to obtain configuration
information about a user's Go environment. It is distributed as a Package
Control dependency, and thus automatically installed when a package requiring
it is installed by an end-user.

 - [Example](#example)

## Overview

### subprocess_info()

`subprocess_info()` is the primary function that will be used in packages.
It accepts five parameters. The first two are positional:

 1. the name of the requested executable, e.g. "go", "gofmt", "godoc"
 2. a list of required environment variables

The three remaining parameters are keyword arguments:

 - optional_vars: a list of vars that will be pulled from project or Sublime
   Text settings and used as environment variables
 - view: a `sublime.View` object, if available
 - window: a `sublime.Window` object, if available

The function returns a two-element tuple containing the path to the requested
executable and a `dict` to pass via the `env=` arg of `subprocess.Popen()`.

The `sublime.View` and/or `sublime.Window` objects are used to obtain
project-specific settings. These objects are available via attributes of the
`sublime_plugin.WindowCommand` and `sublime_plugin.TextCommand` classes.

The `golangconfig` package interacts with Sublime Text's settings API, which
means that all calls must occur within the UI thread for compatibility with
Sublime Text 2.

### setting_value()

The function `setting_value()` is intended for use when fetching environment
variables for non-subprocess usage, or for getting settings that are not
environment variables. Obtaining the value of an individual environment variable
may be useful when printing debug information, or using the value in an
interactive manner with the user.

The function accepts three parameters. The first is position:

 1. a unicode string of the name of the setting or environment variable

The two other parameters are keyword arguments:

 - view: a `sublime.View` object, if available
 - window: a `sublime.Window` object, if available

The function returns a two-element tuple containing the value of the setting
requested, and a unicode string describing the source of the setting.

If no value was found for the setting, the tuple `(None, None)` will be
returned.

If a value is found for the setting, the second element of the tuple will
contain one of the following unicode strings:

 - "project file"
 - "project file (os-specific)"
 - "golang.sublime-settings"
 - "golang.sublime-settings (os-specific)"
 - a unicode string of the path to the user's login shell

This value is intended for display to the user for help in debugging.

### Errors

If the executable can not be found, a `golangconfig.ExecutableError()` will be
raised. It has two attributes: `.name` which is the name of the executable that
could not be found, and `.dirs` which is a list of the dirs searched by first
looking at the `PATH` from the Sublime Text settings, and then looking at the
shell `PATH` value.

If one of the required environment variables is not set, an
`golangconfig.EnvVarError()` will be raised. It has one attribute: `.missing`
which is a list of all required environment variables that could not be
found in the Sublime Text settings, or the shell environment.

If the `GOROOT` environment variable points to a directory that does not exist
on disk, the `golangconfig.GoRootNotFoundError()` will be raised. It has one
attribute `.directory` that contains a unicode string of the `GOROOT` value.

If one or more of the directories specified in the `GOPATH` environment variable
can not be found on disk, the `golangconfig.GoPathNotFoundError()` will be
raised. It has one attribute `.directories`, which is a list on unicode strings
of the directories that could not be found.

### Requiring the Dependency

When developing a package to utilize `golangconfig`, Package Control needs to be
told to ensure that `golangconfig` is installed. To accomplish this, a file
named `dependencies.json` needs to be placed in the root of the package. The
file should contain the following specification:

```json
{
    "*": {
        "*": [
            "shellenv",
            "golangconfig"
        ]
    }
}
```

This specification indicates that for all operating systems (the outer `*`) and
all versions of Sublime Text (the nested `*`), the dependencies named `shellenv`
and `golangconfig` are required.

## Example

The following snippet of Python show basic usage of `golangconfig` from within
command classes derived from `sublime_plugin.WindowCommand` and
`sublime_plugin.TextCommand`.

```python

        )

        goos_setting = golangconfig.setting_value('GOOS', view=self.view)
        goarch_setting = golangconfig.setting_value('GOARCH', view=self.view)

        # Use the sublime API to show the user OS and ARCH options, with their
        # values from the settings selected by default

```

Since the `golangconfig` functions must be called in the UI thread, commands
will normally look up any necessary information before firing off a thread to
perform a task in the background.
